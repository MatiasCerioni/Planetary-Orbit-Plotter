# Orbit Plotter
Plots a planetary orbit on top of a circle to represent the reference plane and the origin.

Useful for online teaching.

The first two sliders are for perspective. The last four modify the planetary orbit.

To do:
- Put the sliders to the side of the figure (surprisingly difficult, for some reason)
